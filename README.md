# l-system-python
An L-system (Lindenmayer system) generator and visualizer written in Python. The parser can take any set of rules and generate a character sequence that describes the system. It will also vizualize the system. There are currently two systems implemented. One generating a fractal plant/fern and one generating a (binary) fractal tree.
